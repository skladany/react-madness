# React Madness

A simple React based March Madness bracket, which allows you to "Reseed" teams, and uses random.org to "flip a coin" and choose which team progresses to auto-fill your bracket!

## Todo

- flipCoin works manually, but only takes 1 number when hitting play button, why?

- Set up rest of bracket!

## Known Bugs

- `react-numeric-input` -- Allows you to enter in values via keyboard -- which does update state, but then will be out-of-sync with the component.
